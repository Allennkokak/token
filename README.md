# Project Title
My token - My very first token, A simple solidity Smart Contract for a Token.
# Description
MyToken is a Solidity smart contract that provides a basic implementation of a token. It allows for minting and burning of tokens, as well as checking of token balances. The contract defines three public variables: tokenName, tokenAbbrv, and totalSupply. It also uses a mapping called balances to keep track of the balances of each address.

# Getting Started
Installing
To download the code, simply copy and paste it into a Solidity compiler, such as Remix.

# Executing program
To use the contract, you can deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain using a platform such as Remix or Truffle. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract through its functions, such as mint and burn.

# Help
If you have any issues or questions about using the contract, please refer to the Solidity documentation or seek assistance from a Solidity developer.
